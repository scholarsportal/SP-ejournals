# SP-ejournals
Scholars Portal is a service of the Ontario Council of University Libraries. <a href="http://journals.scholarsportal.info">Scholars Portal Ejournals</a> is an XML based digital repository containing over 43,000,000 articles from more than 18,000 full text journals of 30 publishers which covers every academic discipline. SP adopted NLM Journal Archiving and Interchange Tag Set and JATS for its XML based E-journals system using MarkLogic. The publisher's native data is transformed to NLM DTD or JATS Tag Set in SP in order to normalize data elements to a single standard for archiving, display and searching. This document contains the mappings from the publisher's DTD to NLM DTD or JATS.
